1. Line 1 

Issue: Missing `blockchain` property type in the WalletBalance type. 

Solution: Add the `blockchain` property type.

⸻

2. Line 15 

Issue: `const { children, ...rest } = props;` is unnecessary because React will use `{rows}` as the component’s children. 

Solution: Remove `const { children, ...rest } = props;` and use `props` directly instead of `rest`.

⸻

3. Line 19 

Issue: The `blockchain` type is `any`, which is too generic. 

Solution: Replace any with the more specific `Blockchain` type.

⸻

4. Line 19 

Issue: The `getPriority` function uses a switch-case statement, which can impact performance if there are many cases. 

Solution: Use a dictionary-like object or a Map for faster lookups.

⸻

5. Line 54 

Issue: `sortedBalances` lists prices as a dependency in `useMemo`, but `prices` is never used inside the callback. 

Solution: Remove `prices` from the `useMemo` dependency array.

⸻

6. Line 39 

Issue: `lhsPriority` is not defined. 

Solution: The variable name should be `balancePriority`.

⸻

7. Line 40 

Issue: The filter condition `balance.amount <= 0` only shows wallets with amounts less than or equal to zero, which is incorrect. 

Solution: Change the condition to `balance.amount > 0`.

⸻

8. Line 56 

Issue: `formattedBalances` is declared but never used. In the rows calculation, the balance variable has the type `WalletBalance`, not `FormattedWalletBalance`, so `balance.formatted` is undefined at Line 71. 

Solution: Replace `sortedBalances` in Line 63 with `formattedBalances`.
Alternatively, if you want to remove `formattedBalances` and the `FormattedWalletBalance` type, format the amount directly when mapping rows.

⸻

9. Line 64 

Issue: `prices[balance.currency]` may return `undefined` if the currency doesn’t exist in the price list, which could make `usdValue` become `NaN`. 

Solution: Render `usdValue` conditionally based on whether `prices[balance.currency]` is available.

⸻

10. Line 68 

Issue: The list item key is set to `index`. Since the wallet list can change in real time, using `index` as the key can cause React rendering issues. 

Solution: Use a unique value such as `balance.blockchain + balance.currency` as the key.
